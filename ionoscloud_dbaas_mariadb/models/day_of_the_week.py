    IONOS DBaaS MariaDB REST API

    An enterprise-grade Database is provided as a Service (DBaaS) solution that can be managed through a browser-based \"Data Center Designer\" (DCD) tool or via an easy to use API.  The API allows you to create additional MariaDB database clusters or modify existing ones. It is designed to allow users to leverage the same power and flexibility found within the DCD visual tool. Both tools are consistent with their concepts and lend well to making the experience smooth and intuitive.
